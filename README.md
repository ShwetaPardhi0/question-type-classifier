# Question Type Classifier

A simple Python script that classifies user questions into three categories:
- **Math** â†’ If the question contains numbers or math operators (+, -, *, /)  
- **Opinion** â†’ If the question contains words like "think", "feel", "should", "best"  
- **Factual** â†’ All other questions  

Depending on the type, the script gives a basic response.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Detects whether a question is **factual**, **opinion**, or **math**.
- Solves basic math expressions using Python's `eval()`.
- Runs in a simple loop until the user types `exit`.
